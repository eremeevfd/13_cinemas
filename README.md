# Cinemas

Thank you for using my script for choosing cinema to go.

# Description

Script gets current cinema list from [here](http://www.afisha.ru/msk/schedule_cinema/).
Gets number of cinema shows, rating and number of votes for each film.
And outputs 10 top films by rating and not arthouse (so you can find more than 1-2 cinemas to
go).
